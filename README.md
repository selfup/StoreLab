# StoreLab

JavaScript State Tree!

### Installation/Usage

This was built with modern build tools in mind.

Frontend assumptions are that you use a build tool:

1. Webpack
2. Grunt
3. Gulp

This is transpiled to ES5 from ES6 so any modern Node version will work :smile:

You might need a polyfill for `Object.assign` :joy:

### Example

To run the example: `node ./example/simple.js`

### DISCLAIMER

This is a continuation of reegux/vue-reegux/controllux
